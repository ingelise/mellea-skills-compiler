"""
The writers (`config_writer.py`, `fixtures_writer.py`, ...) were originally
documented as "the LLM follows them" — but the slash command runs with
`--allowed-tools Read,Write,Edit` and cannot execute Python. So in practice
the LLM was mentally rendering the writer's output, which is unreliable for
anything more complex than `config.py`.

This module moves writer invocation into the compile pipeline, where Python
actually runs. Two operating modes:

  - WARN (observation only): render via the writer, diff against the file the
    LLM wrote, log a warning if they differ, do NOT overwrite.
  - ENFORCE: render via the writer, write authoritatively, deletes whatever
    the LLM put there. Combine with `Write(...)` deny rules in --settings to
    prevent the LLM writing the path in the first place.

Migration plan:
  1. WARN mode for `config_writer` (this commit) — gather evidence the diffs
     are stable and bounded across compiles.
  2. After ~5 clean compiles, flip `config_writer` to ENFORCE + add deny rule.
  3. Repeat for `fixtures_writer`.

Each writer module exposes a `render(emission: dict) -> str` function returning
Python source text. The wrapper reads the emission JSON the LLM emitted, calls
render(), and either compares-and-warns or writes-authoritatively.
